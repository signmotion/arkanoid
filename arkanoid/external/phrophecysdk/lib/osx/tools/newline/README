  newline tool for the UNIX version of Prophecy SDK

-------------------------------------------------------

Little program to add newlines at the end of each file, since gcc 2.96 
and above will give out warnings when a newline is not found at the end of a 
file. Occassionally, gcc will also crash when too many of those errors are 
found.

  usage examples:
-------------------

newline *
newline *.c
