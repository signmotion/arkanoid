More info later, but basically here's a few rules. Prophecy requires GCC 3.0+, 
2.95 will not suffice. I have found though that the stock compiler of RH 7.3
works fine. Although do not attempt with earlier versions. NASM is also 
required and may be found on your RedHat installation CD (or rpmfind.net)

Makefiles are in /lib/linux

Documentation is non-existant, but neverless this system is extremely well 
designed that you should be able to pick it up in no time.

There is some issues with window styles (ie. WINDOW_USES3D, WINDOW_FULLSCREEN)
that remain to be resolved, if you need help just send an e-mail.

Some things such as framebuffer support is not supported. Hopefully when 
OpenGL 2.0 makes it's way out, we'll support it.

Other things such as proper mouse, keyboard support and joystick completed 
will not be coded by myself, so if you want to tackle them, please do so)

Jukka's Tiny Linux HOW-TO v0.667
Last Updated: 14th March 2003


- installing the NASM -

1. download NASM (netwide assembler) from www.sourceforge.net
2. install NASM

- downloading the sourcecode -

3. download PRSDK (you done this already, obviously)
4. unzip PRSDK: "unzip prophecyNNN.zip -d prsdk"
   *) the unzip might not be part of Linux installation you are using, in which
      case the usual steps should be followed to install it. ;-)

- installing the newline -

5. "cd prsdk/lib/unix/tools/newline"
6. make
7. install the newline tool (you need root privileges): "cp ./newline /usr/bin"

- compiling and installing the sourcecode -

8. "cd ../.."
9. "make newline"
10. "make"
11. "make install"


You're ready to go. Feel free to omit some steps, like installing NASM or "newline",
if done previously, or install to different folder or whatnot. But that "simple" sequence
of things to do should enable getting the SDK ready for action with minimal fuss. I'm not
a Linux expert (or even novice) so suggestions for improvements are welcome.

Contributions and help is also welcome, as we don't really use the Linux version ourselves much,
so all the maintenance is done by me and Edmond Cote with very little actual testing/use. Keeping
the Linux version mostly up-to-date for the rainy day, you never know.. ;-)
